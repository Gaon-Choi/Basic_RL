# Basic_RL
Reinforcement Learning with Python and Keras


## Introduction

The purpose is understanding the basic things of RL(Reinforcement Learning) and implementing each things with Python 3 and Keras. The contents of this repository are as follows.

* **The concept and background of RL**
* **Basic RL theorem**: MDP, Bellman Equation and Dynamic Programming
* **Classical RL Algorithm**: Monte Carlo, SARSA and Q-Learning
* **RL Algorithm using ANN**(Artificial Neural Network): Deep SARSA, REINFORCE, DQN, Actor-Critic and A3C
* **Implementing RL Algorithm with games**: Grid World, Cart Paul and ATARI Game
